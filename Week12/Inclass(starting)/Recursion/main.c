// recursion - solve a problem by breaking it down into 
// smaller, similar subproblems until a base case (a 
// condition that stops the recursion) is reached.

// a useful programming construct, but *in C* we should only
// use recursion when absolutely required (use a loop as often 
// as possible)

// let's consider the math function 'factorial'
