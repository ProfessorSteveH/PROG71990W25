The important points so far:
1) coding is hard, but attainable, given practice and continued engagement
2) there are many tools out there, all of them are 'the same', choose 
     the one you like.  And experiment, if you fell a bit curious
3) we will be focussed on software quality, but working results are important
4) professor is here to help - please reaach out with your best questions


Today:
1) a smidge of software development process (you have whole classes on this, I will cover just enough to boot-strap you getting started).
1.5) MVP and how we can use it to our advantage 
2) Build recipes:  .vcxproj, Makefile, CmakeLists.txt
3) creating VS solutions and projects
3) first example of problem solving into code...
